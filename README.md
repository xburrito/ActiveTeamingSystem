3. At the login window, click register underneath to create an account. **{If you already have one, skip to part 7}**

4. Fill out registration form. Make sure reference is valid and properly paired with their status and hit register now.

6. Once registration form has been successfully processed, a pop-up notifies you that the SU will review your application and either approve or reject it. **If approved, your application will be appended to the User.csv database and you will be able to log in as a OU or VIP depending on initial given reputation score.**

(**To approve of application, go and login to - User: adminOU@gmail.com / Password: root, enter messages, and click approve application. Applicant should now be able to login with registered credentials.**)

7. At the home screen, OU and VIP should be able to view other user profiles, messages, the groups they are actively participating in, projects, meeting poll pages as well as the settings option to change their username and/or password. At the home screen, users should be able to interact with other users through messaging, sending collaboration requests as well as compliment to raise the receiving party's reputation score. 

8. Clicking the logOut button on the left column will prompt a sign up pop-up. Upon confirming, you will be redirected to the browse page where you can view the top profiles as well as the top teams. Top left corner **Go Back** will redirect you to the login page.
